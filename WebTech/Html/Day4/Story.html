        <p>&nbsp;<big><span style="color: red;">Once upon a time</span></big>, in a <span style="color: blue;">quiet village</span> near the forest, there lived a <span style="color: green;"><i>poor but honest</i></span> woodcutter named <mark>Ramu</mark>.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;Every day, he would go to the forest, chop wood, and sell it in the market. One day, while cutting a tree near a river his
<u><span style="color: brown;">axe</span></u> accidentally fell into the water. He panicked. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;He sat by the river and <span style="color: red;"><del>cried loudly</del></span> <span style="color: green;"><u>prayed silently</u></span>. Suddenly, a fairy appeared in a flash of light.     &#x1F5A4;    &#10024;</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;<big><q style="color: violet;">Why are you sad ?</q></big> she asked.</p>
        
        <p style="color: gray;">&nbsp;"My only axe fell into the river. I can't work now."</p>
         
        <p>&nbsp;The fairy dived into the river and came up with a <span style="color: gold;">golden axe</span>.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;<q style="color: orange;">Is this yours?</q> she asked.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;<q style="color: blue;"><u>No,madam.</u></q> replied Ramu. The fairy smiled and brought a <span style="color: silver;">silver axe</span>.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;Again, he said, <q style="color: forestgreen;"><i>No, not mine.</i></q> Finally, she brought his <span style="color: brown;">old iron axe</span>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<big><q style="color: green;">Yes! That's mine!</q></big> he said joyfully.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;The fairy was impressed by his honesty and gave him all <sup style="color: red;">three</sup> axes. &#10024;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;When Ramu told this story to his <sub style="color: red;">greedy neighbour</sub>, he too went to the river and threw his axe, hoping for gold.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;But when the fairy offered him the golden axe first, he lied and said, <big><q style="color: red;">Yes! That's mine!</q></big></p>
        <p>&nbsp;The fairy <del style="color: gray;">rewerded him</del> <u style="color: blue;">disappeared with the axe</u> and he lost his tool forever. < sad ending ></p>
