        <h1 style="color: coral;">About Charminar</h1>
        <p style="background-color: ivory;">The Charminar (lit. 'four minarets') is a monument located in Hyderabad, 
            Telangana, India. Constructed in 1591, the landmark is a symbol of Hyderabad and officially 
            incorporated in the emblem of Telangana.[3] The Charminar's long history includes the existence of a 
            mosque on its top floor for more than 434 years. While both historically and religiously significant,
            it is also known for its popular and busy local markets surrounding the structure, and has become one
            of the most frequented tourist attractions in Hyderabad. Charminar is also a site of numerous 
            festival celebrations, such as Eid-ul-adha and Eid al-Fitr,[4] as it is adjacent to the city's 
            main mosque, the Makkah Masjid.

        <h1 style="color: orange;">About Tiger &#128047</h1>
        <p style="color: whitesmoke;background-color: burlywood;">The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a large cat and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia. 
            It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black,
            mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some 
            recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.

            Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf 
            and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist 
            broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and 
            preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies 
            home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps 
            with that of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs 
            that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's 
            home range and establish their own.</p>

        <h1>About Lion &#129409;</h1>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India. 
            It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at 
            the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a 
            prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a 
            few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying 
            mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.

The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, 
but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion 
ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented 
populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the 
IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. 
Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,
habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</p>

        <h1>About Monkey &#128053</h1>
        <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, 
            also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are 
            counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete 
            paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians 
            are synonyms.

In 1812, Étienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established 
the name Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys" ("singes de l'Ancien Monde" in French).[3][4][5] The extant sister of 
the Catarrhini in the monkey ("singes") group is the Platyrrhini (New World monkeys).[3] Some nine million years 
before the divergence between the Cercopithecidae and the apes,[6] the Platyrrhini emerged within "monkeys" by 
migration to South America from Afro-Arabia (the Old World),[citation needed][7][8] 
likely by ocean.[9][10][better source needed] Apes are thus deep in the tree of extant and extinct monkeys, 
and any of the apes is distinctly closer related to the Cercopithecidae than the Platyrrhini are.</p>
